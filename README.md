# Commander X16 GUI Launcher
An unofficial, crude graphical user interface for launching the Commander X16 Emulator, without needing to use the terminal or knowing the relevent terminal flags.

For more information about the Commander X16 and how to support their project, [visit the Commander X16 Official website](https://www.commanderx16.com/).

Made in .NET 8.0, with AvaloniaUI and ReactiveUI.

**Please note:** This launcher probably won't support all of the known commands, so some terminal usage may be needed for more advanced use cases. The purpose of this launcher was aimed at getting the emulator up and running quickly and easily for more novice to intermediate users, especially those not comfortable in using a command-line interface.

* Special thanks to @stacbats on Discord for unconsiously giving me the idea to create this :)
* A nod to OldSkoolCoder [GitHub](https://github.com/OldSkoolCoder/) / [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/OldSkoolCoder) because the need came from watching and interacting with their twitch streams.
